      description: >-
        This method will find DHL locations based on an address by first
        converting the address to a reference point (latitude, longitude) and
        then finding locations near that point. To convert an address to a
        reference point, this API uses the ``Google Geocoding API Address``. To
        optimize results, besides ``countryCode`` you need to provide
        ``addressLocality`` and /or ``postalCode``. The more address fields you
        provide, the better results you may get.


        Please read Google Geocoding API Terms of Use:
        https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms


        ``Limitations:`` Address fields are not filters. 3rd party Geocoding
        API hence limited control over results.
