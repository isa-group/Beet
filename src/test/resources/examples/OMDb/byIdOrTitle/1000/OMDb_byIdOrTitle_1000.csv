Both groups of students come away forever changed by their experience, and better prepared to be citizens of our increasingly globalized world."",""Language"":""English, Nepali"",""Country"":""United States, Nepal"",""Awards"":""N/A"",""Poster"":""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MzE4NTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk4NTI4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg"",""Ratings"":[{""Source"":""Internet Movie Database"",""Value"":""9.1/10""}],""Metascore"":""N/A"",""imdbRating"":""9.1"",""imdbVotes"":""21"",""imdbID"":""tt1505367"",""Type"":""movie"",""DVD"":""N/A"",""BoxOffice"":""N/A"",""Production"":""N/A"",""Website"":""N/A"",""Response"":""True""}"

Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend \""Jessica\"", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks."",""Language"":""Korean, English"",""Country"":""South Korea"",""Awards"":""Won 4 Oscars. 308 wins & 271 nominations total"",""Poster"":""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZjMjk3ZTItODQ2ZC00NTY5LWE0ZDYtZTI3MjcwN2Q5NTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_SX300.jpg"",""Ratings"":[{""Source"":""Internet Movie Database"",""Value"":""8.5/10""},{""Source"":""Rotten Tomatoes"",""Value"":""99%""},{""Source"":""Metacritic"",""Value"":""96/100""}],""Metascore"":""96"",""imdbRating"":""8.5"",""imdbVotes"":""769,950"",""imdbID"":""tt6751668"",""Type"":""movie"",""DVD"":""11 Oct 2019"",""BoxOffice"":""$53,369,749"",""Production"":""N/A"",""Website"":""N/A"",""Response"":""True""}"

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \""blade runners\"", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \""retiring\"" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her."",""Language"":""English, German, Cantonese, Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Korean"",""Country"":""United States"",""Awards"":""Nominated for 2 Oscars. 12 wins & 19 nominations total"",""Poster"":""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzMzJhZTEtOWM4NS00MTdhLTg0YjgtMjM4MDRkZjUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg"",""Ratings"":[{""Source"":""Internet Movie Database"",""Value"":""8.1/10""},{""Source"":""Rotten Tomatoes"",""Value"":""89%""},{""Source"":""Metacritic"",""Value"":""84/100""}],""Metascore"":""84"",""imdbRating"":""8.1"",""imdbVotes"":""759,861"",""imdbID"":""tt0083658"",""Type"":""movie"",""DVD"":""30 Oct 2001"",""BoxOffice"":""$32,914,489"",""Production"":""N/A"",""Website"":""N/A"",""Response"":""True""}"

What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."",""Language"":""English, Italian, Latin"",""Country"":""United States"",""Awards"":""Won 3 Oscars. 31 wins & 30 nominations total"",""Poster"":""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MyNjYxNmUtYTAwNi00MTYxLWJmNWYtYzZlODY3ZTk3OTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg"",""Ratings"":[{""Source"":""Internet Movie Database"",""Value"":""9.2/10""},{""Source"":""Rotten Tomatoes"",""Value"":""97%""},{""Source"":""Metacritic"",""Value"":""100/100""}],""Metascore"":""100"",""imdbRating"":""9.2"",""imdbVotes"":""1,823,905"",""imdbID"":""tt0068646"",""Type"":""movie"",""DVD"":""11 May 2004"",""BoxOffice"":""$136,381,073"",""Production"":""N/A"",""Website"":""N/A"",""Response"":""True""}"

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \""blade runners\"", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \""retiring\"" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her."",""Language"":""English, German, Cantonese, Japanese, Hungarian, Arabic, Korean"",""Country"":""United States"",""Awards"":""Nominated for 2 Oscars. 12 wins & 19 nominations total"",""Poster"":""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzMzJhZTEtOWM4NS00MTdhLTg0YjgtMjM4MDRkZjUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg"",""Ratings"":[{""Source"":""Internet Movie Database"",""Value"":""8.1/10""},{""Source"":""Rotten Tomatoes"",""Value"":""89%""},{""Source"":""Metacritic"",""Value"":""84/100""}],""Metascore"":""84"",""imdbRating"":""8.1"",""imdbVotes"":""759,861"",""imdbID"":""tt0083658"",""Type"":""movie"",""DVD"":""30 Oct 2001"",""BoxOffice"":""$32,914,489"",""Production"":""N/A"",""Website"":""N/A"",""Response"":""True""}"
